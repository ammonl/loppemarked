# Terraform Layout

This directory contains environment stacks, reusable modules, and the
one-time bootstrap configuration for remote state and account-level
prerequisites.

## Directory Structure

```
infra/terraform/
├── bootstrap/          # One-time state backend provisioning
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── variables.tf
├── environments/
│   ├── prod/main.tf    # Production stack (isolated state)
│   └── staging/main.tf # Staging stack (isolated state)
└── modules/
    └── loppemarked_stack/  # Shared module composing AWS resources
```

## Conventions

- Use one environment directory per deploy target.
- Keep modules focused and composable.
- Tag all resources with:
  - `project=loppemarked`
  - `season=2026`
  - `environment=<env>`
  - `managed_by=terraform`

## State Backend

Remote state uses an S3 bucket with DynamoDB locking.

| Resource        | Name                       |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| S3 bucket       | `loppemarked-2026-tfstate`  |
| DynamoDB table  | `loppemarked-2026-tflock`   |
| Region          | `eu-north-1`               |

State paths are isolated per environment:

- `environments/staging/terraform.tfstate`
- `environments/prod/terraform.tfstate`

Versioning is enabled on the S3 bucket so prior state can be recovered.

## Bootstrap Workflow (one-time)

The `bootstrap/` directory creates account-level prerequisites that all
other stacks depend on. Run this once before initializing environments.

### Resources created

| Resource                       | Purpose                                       |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| S3 bucket                      | Terraform remote state                        |
| DynamoDB table                 | State locking                                 |
| IAM OIDC identity provider     | GitHub Actions OIDC trust (keyless CI auth)   |
| `ci_terraform` IAM role + inline policies | Per-environment plan/apply role assumed by the Terraform workflow |

The `ci_terraform` role is intentionally owned by bootstrap (not by the
per-environment stack it governs). When a permission is added to the
inline policies, IAM eventual consistency briefly denies the new action
to a session that was created moments earlier with the old policy. If
the policy were updated by an apply that the role itself executes — as
it was before — that same apply would attempt to use the new permission
within the propagation window and fail. Granting permissions from
bootstrap (with admin credentials) ensures the policy is in effect
before any environment apply assumes the role.

To grant a new permission:

1. Edit `bootstrap/ci_terraform_role.tf` and add the action / resource.
2. From `infra/terraform/bootstrap/`, run `terraform apply` with admin
   credentials.
3. The next environment apply (CI or local) sees the new permission.

### Steps

```bash
cd infra/terraform/bootstrap
terraform init
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform apply tfplan
```

After the bootstrap resources exist, environment stacks can be initialized
with their remote backend. No manual AWS Console steps are required.

### Importing an existing OIDC provider

If the GitHub OIDC provider was previously created manually in the AWS
Console, import it into bootstrap state before applying:

```bash
cd infra/terraform/bootstrap
terraform import aws_iam_openid_connect_provider.github \
  arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com
```

### Migrating ci_terraform role from environment state to bootstrap state

The `ci_terraform` role used to be created by the per-environment stack.
On environments provisioned before that change, run the following one
time before applying bootstrap. The commands relocate ownership of the
existing role into bootstrap state without recreating it (the role ARN,
trust policy, and inline policies stay the same).

```bash
# 1. Drop the role + its inline policies from each environment's state.
for ENV in staging prod; do
  terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/environments/$ENV state rm \
    aws_iam_role.ci_terraform \
    aws_iam_role_policy.ci_terraform_state \
    aws_iam_role_policy.ci_terraform_resources
done

# 2. Import the role + policies into bootstrap state.
cd infra/terraform/bootstrap
terraform import 'aws_iam_role.ci_terraform["staging"]' \
  loppemarked-staging-2026-ci-terraform
terraform import 'aws_iam_role.ci_terraform["prod"]' \
  loppemarked-prod-2026-ci-terraform
terraform import 'aws_iam_role_policy.ci_terraform_state["staging"]' \
  loppemarked-staging-2026-ci-terraform:terraform-state
terraform import 'aws_iam_role_policy.ci_terraform_state["prod"]' \
  loppemarked-prod-2026-ci-terraform:terraform-state
terraform import 'aws_iam_role_policy.ci_terraform_resources["staging"]' \
  loppemarked-staging-2026-ci-terraform:terraform-resources
terraform import 'aws_iam_role_policy.ci_terraform_resources["prod"]' \
  loppemarked-prod-2026-ci-terraform:terraform-resources

# 3. Plan + apply. Expected diff: tag additions (environment=staging|prod)
#    and the broadened DenySelfModify statement (now also denies
#    iam:PutRolePolicy / iam:DeleteRolePolicy on the role itself).
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform apply tfplan
```

## Environment Init / Apply Workflow

For each environment (`staging` or `prod`):

```bash
cd infra/terraform/environments/<env>
terraform init
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform apply tfplan
```

### CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/terraform.yml`)

The Terraform workflow triggers on pull requests and pushes to `main` when
files under `infra/terraform/` change. AWS authentication uses GitHub OIDC
(`aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`) — no long-lived keys.

#### Pull requests (internal)

For PRs from the same repository, the workflow runs a format check and
per-environment plan jobs in parallel:

- **Format Check** (`fmt-check`) — runs `terraform fmt -check -recursive`
  across all Terraform files. No AWS credentials required.
- **Plan (staging)** / **Plan (prod)** — each environment runs its own plan:
  1. Authenticate to AWS via OIDC using the environment-specific role.
  2. `terraform init` with the real S3 backend.
  3. `terraform validate`.
  4. `terraform plan` — output is saved as a CI artifact (retained 7 days).

#### Pull requests (forks)

Fork PRs receive no AWS credentials. A single `validate-fork` job runs:

1. `terraform fmt -check -recursive` across all Terraform files.
2. Per environment: `terraform init -backend=false` and `terraform validate`.

#### Merge to main / workflow dispatch

On push to `main` (or manual dispatch from `main`), the deploy pipeline runs:

1. **Detect changes** (`detect-staging`, `detect-prod`) — runs
   `terraform plan -detailed-exitcode` for each environment in parallel. If no
   changes are detected, downstream apply jobs are skipped.
2. **Apply staging** (`apply-staging`) — auto-applies when staging has changes.
   Uses the `staging` GitHub environment.
3. **Apply production** (`apply-prod`) — runs automatically after staging
   succeeds (or is skipped). Uses the `production` GitHub environment.

Concurrency guards (`terraform-deploy-staging`, `terraform-deploy-prod`)
prevent parallel applies to the same environment.

#### IAM roles

Each environment has a `ci-terraform` IAM role assumed via OIDC. Role ARNs
are stored in GitHub repository variables:

| Variable              | Purpose                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `TF_ROLE_ARN_STAGING` | OIDC role ARN for staging plan/apply |
| `TF_ROLE_ARN_PROD`    | OIDC role ARN for prod plan/apply    |

## Amplify Hosting

Each environment provisions an AWS Amplify app for the Next.js frontend
(`apps/web`). Amplify builds from source using the `WEB_COMPUTE` platform
(SSR support).

### Custom Domains

| Environment | Domain                              |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| staging     | `loppemarked.staging.un17hub.com`    |
| production  | `loppemarked.un17hub.com`            |

### TLS

Amplify provisions and auto-renews ACM certificates via the domain
association. When the Route 53 hosted zone is in the same AWS account,
Amplify automatically creates DNS validation records—no manual certificate
management is required.

### Build Configuration

Amplify uses the build spec embedded in the Terraform configuration:

- **App root**: `apps/web`
- **Install**: `npm ci`
- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Artifacts**: `.next/**/*`

The `API_URL` environment variable is automatically set to the Lambda function
URL from the same stack, so Next.js API rewrites point to the correct backend.

### Deployment Modes

| Environment | Auto-build | Trigger                                    |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| staging     | enabled    | Push to `main` triggers automatic build    |
| production  | disabled   | Manual deployment via Amplify console / CI |

#### Required PR status checks

The following status checks should be required in the `main` branch
protection rule:

| Workflow  | Job name          | Purpose                                  |
| --------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| CI        | `infra-checks`    | `terraform fmt` + `validate` (backend-disabled) |
| CI        | `app-checks`      | Lint, test, build for application code   |
| Terraform | `Format Check`    | `terraform fmt -check -recursive` on infra changes |

The Terraform `Format Check` job runs on all PRs that touch
`infra/terraform/**`. It requires no AWS credentials and blocks merge when
formatting is invalid. Because the Terraform workflow only triggers on
`infra/terraform/**` path changes, configure this check in branch protection
with "Do not require this check to have run" so non-infra PRs are not blocked.

#### How to verify

- **PR plans**: check the `Plan (staging)` and `Plan (prod)` job logs, or
  download the `tfplan-staging` / `tfplan-prod` artifacts from the workflow
  run.
- **Deploy plans**: download `deploy-tfplan-staging` / `deploy-tfplan-prod`
  artifacts from the workflow run to review what will be applied.
- **Apply runs**: check the `Apply (staging)` and `Apply (prod)` job logs
  under the Actions tab for the merge commit on `main`.
- **Prod apply**: the `Apply (prod)` job runs automatically after staging
  succeeds (or is skipped when staging has no changes).
- **No-change plans**: when `terraform plan` detects no changes, the detect
  job outputs `has_changes=false` and the apply job is skipped entirely.
